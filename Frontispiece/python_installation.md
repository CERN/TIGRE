Installation Instructions for Python
======

## Windows

### Requirements:

1. Python 3
2. MVS
3. A CUDA capable GPU from NVIDIA with [compute capability greater or equal to 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported)
4. CUDA Toolkit

Tested on

| Software        | Version           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|**Windows**| 10 |
|**Python**| 3.7 3.8 |
|**CUDA**| 10.1 |
|**MSVC**| 19.24 |

### Simple Instructions

1. Install Python and pip, MSVC and CUDA
2. run `git clone https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git` 
3. run `python setup.py install --user` in the Python folder. 

A succesfull installation should be able to execute the script at `TIGRE/Python/example.py`

### Step by Step Instructions:

1. Install [MS Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with Windows SDK.\
   **NOTE:** The User has to have no spaces.
	
2. Install Python 3 + pip. You can use a virtual [conda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/) or just a normal python installation.

3. Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Make sure the `CUDA_PATH` and `PATH` environment variable are set accordingly.\
  **NOTE:** The User has to have no spaces.


4. Download/clone TIGRE

	`git clone https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git` 

5. Compile libraries

	`cd TIGRE/Python/`  
	`python setup.py install --user`

	Install in this case will make a copy of pytigre to your python distribution. Therefore the `develop` command is more useful when modifying the source files and developing the software. 

	`python setup.py develop --user`

6. Try demo 3. If it runs succesfully then you are good to go.

**Note:** It is known that the package cannot be imported using a pure Python 3.8 installation, i.e.
not using a conda environment. Please try a pure installation of Python 3.7 or consider using a
conda environment.

## Linux

### Requirements:

1. Python 2/Python 3
2. gcc
3. A CUDA capable GPU from NVIDIA with [compute capability greater or equal to 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported)
4. CUDA Toolkit


Tested on

| Software        | Version           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|**Ubuntu**| 16.04 17.10|
|**Python**| 2.7 3.7 |
|**CUDA**| 8.0 9.2 10.1 10.2|
|**gcc**|  7.6.0|

### Simple Instructions

1. Install python, gcc, pip and CUDA
2. run `git clone https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git` 
3. run `python setup.py install --user` in the Python folder. 

A succesfull installation should be able to execute the script at `TIGRE/Python/example.py`

### Step by Step Instructions:

For Ubuntu

1. Install python and pip (you can use 2 or 3, example show for 2)

	```
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	sudo apt install python2.7 python-pip
	```
	
2. Install CUDA

   Installing CUDA in linux (specially one with a GUI) can be a challenge. Please follow [NVIDIAs instructions](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.0/Prod/docs/sidebar/CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf) carefully.\
   [CUDA download link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

3. Install gcc 

   gcc should already be installed in your linux, as it is part of the linux distribution.\
   If you need to install an older version of gcc, [read here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/923337/installing-an-older-gcc-version3-4-3-on-ubuntu-14-04-currently-4-8-installed).

4. Download/clone TIGRE

	`git clone https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git` 

5. Compile libraries

	`cd TIGRE/Python/` 
	`python setup.py install --user`

	Install in this case will make a copy of pytigre to your python distribution. Therefore the `develop` command is more useful when modifying the source files and developing the software. 

	`python setup.py develop --user`

6. Try demo 3. If it runs succesfully then you are good to go. 

if this fails, then try:

`export CUDAHOME=yourcudahome`, e.g. default is `export CUDAHOME=/usr/local/cuda`
`python setup.py install --user`

**NOTE:** as of November 2020 the pip pytigre is behind the main repo, we recomedn you install it and compile it yourself. Trying to fix that. 

## Optional Code Style Enforcement
Optional linting dependences are provided to enforce the prevailing codestyle in the Python component of the TIGRE library.

The primary linting packages utilized are:
  * [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for automatic code formatting
  * [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code style enforcement

Multiple installation options have been provided:

### `pip` Installation
#### Option 1: `requirements_dev.txt`
A `requirements_dev` file is located in Tigre's `Python` directory. These dependencies can be installed using `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt --user` while in the `Python` directory.

#### Option 2: `setup.py`
Dev dependencies may also be installed using the `lint` extras defined in `setup.py`. These dependencies can be installed using `pip install .[lint] --user` while in the `Python` directory.

### pre-commit
Linting dependencies are also provided as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration. With the pre-commit hooks installed, code will be linted prior to commit, preventing code from being committed that fails linting. By default, these hooks are only run against staged files.

The pre-commit package is included in the above `pip` installs; once the framework is installed, hooks can be installed by invoking `pre-commit install`.

### Usage
Once installed, invoking the linting tools is straightforward. From TIGRE's `Python` directory:

```bash
# Run in current directory & subdirectories
$ flake8 .
$ black .

# Or specify a file
$ flake8 ./example.py
$ black ./example.py
```

pre-commit may also be manually invoked, which will run `flake8` and `black` against all staged files:

```bash
$ pre-commit run
flake8...................................................................Passed
black....................................................................Passed
Check for merge conflicts................................................Passed
Check Toml...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
Check Yaml...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
Fix End of Files.........................................................Passed
Mixed line ending........................................................Passed
check blanket noqa.......................................................Passed
```

**NOTE:** pre-commit may also be manually invoked against *all* files (staged and unstaged) using the `pre-commit run --all-files`. However, some changes made to Python's TIGRE codebase by `black` have been manually reverted for readability reasons and should not be committed in their blackened state.
