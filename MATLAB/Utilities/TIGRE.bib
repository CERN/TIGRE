  abstract={In this article the Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction (TIGRE) Toolbox, a MATLAB/CUDA toolbox for fast and accurate 3D x-ray image reconstruction, is presented. One of the key features is the implementation of a wide variety of iterative algorithms as well as FDK, including a range of algorithms in the SART family, the Krylov subspace family and a range of methods using total variation regularization. Additionally, the toolbox has GPU-accelerated projection and back projection using the latest techniques and it has a modular design that facilitates the implementation of new algorithms. We present an overview of the structure and techniques used in the creation of the toolbox, together with two usage examples. The TIGRE Toolbox is released under an open source licence, encouraging people to contribute.}

  abstract={An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.}

abstract = {A convolution-backprojection formula is deduced for direct reconstruction of a three-dimensional density function from a set of two-dimensional projections. The formula is approximate but has useful properties, including errors that are relatively small in many practical instances and a form that leads to convenient computation. It reduces to the standard fan-beam formula in the plane that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation and contains the point source. The algorithm is applied to a mathematical phantom as an example of its performance.},
